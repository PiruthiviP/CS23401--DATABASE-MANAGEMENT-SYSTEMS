# CS23401--DATABASE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS


Welcome to the repository for CS23401--DATABASE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS ! This repository houses course materials, lab experiments, and report records.

## Objectives

- Learn the fundamentals of Java language constructs
- Familiarize with Object-Oriented Programming in Java
- Explore UI creation
- Understand parallel programming concepts
- Develop web applications using Java

## Outcomes

Upon completion of the course, students will be able to:

- Model an application’s data requirements using conceptual modeling tools like ER diagrams and design database schemas based on the conceptual model
- Formulate solutions to a broad range of query problems using relational algebra/ SQL
- Apply normalization theory to normalize the relations in RDBMS to avoid redundancy and
anomalies.
- Manage concurrent transactions and their consequences, and analyze the use of triggers,
functions, and procedures in a realistic database application.
- Understand database storage structures and access techniques
